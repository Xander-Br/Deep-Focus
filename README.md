# Deep Focus
## _The tool to monitor an online class attention rate_

Deep focus is a tool developed during the Odoo Hackathon 2022. 
We were a team of 3 and got around 30h of development time

### What is it ?
It's an chrome extension that help the teacher monitor his online class attention rate on Jitsi.

### Why we got this idea ?
We are a group of students who all got online class during Covid-19 and for each one of us remarked that a lot of student weren't attentive to the class that the teacher gave.
People are thinking that is always the student fault but they don't know what is to follow long and monotonous class all day long.

### How is it helping ?
The teacher can monitor the class average attention at any time and so he can adapt his class and dynamise it or understand when his students don't understand the subject.

### What to improve ?
- Remove selenium and use the chrome extension to screenshot the call
- Improve and optimize the AI for speed and cost efficiency
- Make dynamic call to the api or implement a bidirectional transaction technology
- Improve web server code
- Add more meet application to the tool (zoom, google meet or teams) 

## How to try it

Firstly you need to install all the library of python

    pip install requirement.txt

Then in the folder /ui execute this command to install all the library

    npm install

Then you need to build and add the extension to chrome

    npm run build

And to add the /dist folder to chrome

You can now launch the api/main.py and scraping/main.py from the backend and voila
